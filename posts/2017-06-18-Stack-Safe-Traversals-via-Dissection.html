Consider writing an instance for a linked list, for example. The naive instance is not tail recursive, and will build up large
thunks for some <code>Applicative</code> instances:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>traverseList :: forall f a b. Applicative f =&gt; (a -&gt; f b) -&gt; List a -&gt; f (List b)
traverseList f Nil = pure Nil
traverseList f (Cons x xs) = Cons &lt;$&gt; f x &lt;*&gt; traverseList f xs
</code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, we can make this traversal tail recursive by writing it as a fold (this is what the <code>purescript-lists</code> library does,
in fact). But that won&#39;t stop the instance from building up thunks, and it won&#39;t work for other functors. For example, how can we write a safe traversal on a binary tree without allocating an
intermediate list?</p>
<p>While I was thinking about this problem recently, I was reminded of the paper &quot;Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right&quot; by
Conor McBride. The paper shows how to turn a fold over a data type into a step-by-step calculation backed by an explicit stack
of intermediate computations. Interestingly, the shape of the stack can be computed generically from the type of the input structure
by a process called <em>dissection</em>.</p>
<p>In PureScript, the type class for dissectible containers and their associated dissection (a <code>Bifunctor</code>) looks like this:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>class (Traversable f, Bifunctor d) &lt;= Dissectible f d | f -&gt; d where
  moveRight :: forall c j. Either (f j) (Tuple (d c j) c) -&gt; Either (f c) (Tuple (d c j) j)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>moveRight</code> structure allows us to move right inside the container, one step at a time, turning a &quot;joker&quot; on the right into
a &quot;clown&quot; on the left at each step.</p>
<p>We can write an instance for lists, or many other types of container (including trees):</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>instance dissectibleList :: Dissectible List (Product (Clown List) (Joker List)) where
  moveRight (Left Nil) = Left Nil
  moveRight (Left (j : js)) = Right (Tuple (Product (Clown Nil) (Joker js)) j)
  moveRight (Right (Tuple (Product (Clown cs) (Joker js)) c)) =
    case js of
      Nil -&gt; Left (reverse (c : cs))
      j : js&#39; -&gt; Right (Tuple (Product (Clown (c : cs)) (Joker js&#39;)) j)
</code></pre>
<p>As an example of turning a fold into a tail-recursive function, the paper shows how we can implement the <code>map</code> function from the
<code>Functor</code> type class from any container which supports dissection. In PureScript:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>mapP :: forall f d a b. Dissectible f d =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
mapP f xs = tailRec step (Left xs) where
  step = moveRight &gt;&gt;&gt; case _ of
           Left ys -&gt; Done ys
           Right (Tuple dba a) -&gt; Loop (Right (Tuple dba (f a)))
</code></pre>
<p>As I was reading, I noticed I could use the same idea to solve my original problem. Using <code>MonadRec</code>, we can get a
safe traversal for any dissectible container and any <code>MonadRec</code>, simply by switching from a regular tail recursion with
<code>tailRec</code> to a monadic tail recursion with <code>tailRecM</code>:</p>
<pre class="purescript"><code>traverseP :: forall m f d a b. Dissectible f d =&gt; MonadRec m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; f a -&gt; m (f b)
traverseP f xs = tailRecM step (Left xs) where
  step = moveRight &gt;&gt;&gt; case _ of
           Left ys -&gt; pure (Done ys)
           Right (Tuple dba a) -&gt; Loop &lt;&lt;&lt; Right &lt;&lt;&lt; Tuple dba &lt;$&gt; f a
</code></pre>
