When we speak of free objects (free groups, free monoids), what we are really doing is asserting the existence of an adjoint functor for a forgetful functor. Therefore, we expect that the construction of free monads should be adjoint to some functor.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s recap the definition of a free monad.</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>{-# LANGUAGE Rank2Types #-}

import Control.Monad (join)

data Free f a = Return a | Bind (f (Free f a))
</code></pre>
<p>The free monad for a functor <code>f</code> is given by the fixed point of the bifunctor <code>X -&gt; A -&gt; F (X + A)</code> where the fixed point is taken over <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, the free monad describes structures whose pattern of recursion looks like <code>f</code>, but where whole substructures can be replaced with a leaf of type <code>A</code>. The free monad defines a functor in <code>A</code>, and a monad, for any functor <code>f</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance (Functor f) =&gt; Functor (Free f) where
  fmap f (Return x) = Return (f x)
  fmap f (Bind xs) = Bind (fmap (fmap f) xs)

instance (Functor f) =&gt; Monad (Free f) where
  return = Return
  (Return x) &gt;&gt;= f = f x
  (Bind xs) &gt;&gt;= f = Bind $ fmap (&gt;&gt;= f) xs
</code></pre>
<p>As a mapping from functors to monads, <code>Free</code> is also a functor, from the category of endofunctors to the category of monads and monad morphisms. A monad morphism is just a natural transformation which commutes with the return and bind operations.</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>mapFree :: (Functor f, Functor g) =&gt; (forall a. f a -&gt; g a) -&gt; Free f a -&gt; Free g a
mapFree f (Return x) = Return x
mapFree f (Bind xs) = Bind $ f $ fmap (mapFree f) xs
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can show that this functor from endofunctors to monads is actually left adjoint to the forgetful functor which takes a monad and forgets the monadic structure.</p>
<p>We need to give a natural equivalence between hom-sets <code>Free f ~&gt; m</code> in the category of monads and monad morphisms, and <code>f -&gt; Forget m</code> in the category of endofunctors.</p>
<p>That is, we need to define mappings with the following signatures:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>leftAdjunct :: (Functor f, Monad m) =&gt; (forall a. f a -&gt; m a) -&gt; Free f a -&gt; m a
rightAdjunct :: (Functor f, Monad m) =&gt; (forall a. Free f a -&gt; m a) -&gt; f a -&gt; m a
</code></pre>
<p>And then show that these are inverses.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s define these functions by following the types:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>leftAdjunct _ (Return x) = return x
leftAdjunct phi (Bind xs) = join $ phi $ fmap (leftAdjunct phi) xs

rightAdjunct psi = psi . Bind . (fmap Return)
</code></pre>
<p>Using parametricity, it is not hard to see that <code>leftAdjunct</code> followed by <code>rightAdjunct</code> must be the identity since its type is</p>
<pre><code>forall f m. (Functor f, Monad m) =&gt; (forall a. f a -&gt; m a) -&gt; (forall a. f a -&gt; m a)
</code></pre>
<p>In the other direction, we have</p>
<pre><code>leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f) (Return x) = return x
</code></pre>
<p>And <code>f (Return x) = return x</code> because <code>f</code> is a monad morphism.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<pre><code>leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f) (Bind xs) 
  (definition of leftAdjunct)
  = join $ rightAdjunct f $ fmap (leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f)) xs
  (definition of rightAdjunct)
  = join $ f $ Bind $ fmap Return $ fmap (leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f)) xs
  (since f is a monad morphism)
  = f $ join $ Bind $ fmap Return $ fmap (leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f)) xs
  (definition of join)
  = f $ Bind $ fmap (leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f)) xs
  (by structural induction on Free f)
  = f (Bind xs)
</code></pre>
<p>so <code>leftAdjunct (rightAdjunct f)</code> is equal to <code>f</code> and <code>Free</code> is indeed left adjoint to the forgetful functor to <code>Endo C</code>.</p>
<p>The case of cofree comonads is very similar: one can show that the construction of a cofree comonad over a functor <code>f</code> gives a functor from <code>Endo C</code> to comonads and comonad morphisms which is right adjoint to the forgetful functor to <code>Endo C</code>.</p>
