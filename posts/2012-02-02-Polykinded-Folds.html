The approach should generalise easily enough to things such as types indexed by another kind (e.g. by specializing to kind <code>Nat -&gt; *</code>, using the <code>DataKinds</code> extension), or higher order nested datatypes (e.g. by specializing to kind <code>(* -&gt; *) -&gt; (* -&gt; *)</code>).</p>
<p>The following will compile in the new GHC 7.4.1 release. We require the following GHC extensions:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
{-# LANGUAGE PolyKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances #-}
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
</code></pre>
<p>The basic <code>fold</code> and <code>unfold</code> combinators can be written as follows:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>-- fold phi = phi . fmap (fold phi) . out
-- unfold psi = in . fmap (unfold psi) . psi
</code></pre>
<p>The idea now is to generalize these combinators by working over different categories. We can capture the basic operations in a category with a typeclass:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>class Category hom where
  ident :: hom a a
  compose :: hom a b -&gt; hom b c -&gt; hom a c
</code></pre>
<p>A category has two operations: an identity morphism for every object, and for every two compatible morphisms, the composition of those morphisms.</p>
<p>In earlier versions of GHC, the type hom would have been specialized to kind <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>, but with the new <code>PolyKinds</code> extension, hom is polykinded, and the <code>Category</code> typeclass can be instantiated to <code>k -&gt; k -&gt; *</code> for any kind <code>k</code>. This means that in addition to all of the Category instances that we could have written before, we can now write instances of <code>Category</code> for type constructors, type constructor constructors, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the instance for the category Hask of Haskell types. Objects are Haskell types and morphisms are functions between types. The identity is the regular polymorphic identity function <code>id</code>, and composition is given by the (flipped) composition operator <code>(.)</code></p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance Category (-&gt;) where
  ident = id
  compose = flip (.)
</code></pre>
<p>Another example is the category of type constructors and natural transformations. A natural transformation is defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>newtype Nat f g = Nat { nu :: (forall a. f a -&gt; g a) } 
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the Category instance for natural transformations. This time the type hom is inferred to have kind <code>(* -&gt; *) -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code>. Identity and composition are both defined pointwise.</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance Category (Nat :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *) where
  ident = Nat id
  compose f g = Nat (nu g . nu f)
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s define a type class which will capture the idea of a fixed point in a category. This generalizes the idea of recursive types in <code>Hask</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>class Rec hom f t where
  _in :: hom (f t) t
  out :: hom t (f t)
</code></pre>
<p>The class <code>Rec</code> defines two morphisms: <code>_in</code>, which is the constructor of the fixed point type <code>t</code>, and <code>out</code>, its destructor.</p>
<p>The final piece is the definition of a higher order functor, which generalizes the typeclass <code>Functor</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>class HFunctor hom f where
  hmap :: hom a b -&gt; hom (f a) (f b)
</code></pre>
<p>Note the similarity with the type signature of the function <code>fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. Indeed, specializing hom to <code>(-&gt;)</code> in the definition of <code>HFunctor</code> gives back the type signature of <code>fmap</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can define folds and unfolds in a category. The definitions are as before, but with explicit composition, constructors and destructors replaced with the equivalent type class methods, and <code>hmap</code> in place of <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>fold :: (Category hom, HFunctor hom f, Rec hom f rec) =&gt; hom (f t) t -&gt; hom rec t
fold phi = compose out (compose (hmap (fold phi)) phi)

unfold :: (Category hom, HFunctor hom f, Rec hom f rec) =&gt; hom t (f t) -&gt; hom t rec
unfold phi = compose phi (compose (hmap (unfold phi)) _in)
</code></pre>
<p>Now for some examples.</p>
<h2>Example 1 - Folding Binary Leaf Trees</h2>
<p>The first example is a regular recursive datatype of binary leaf trees. The functor <code>FTree</code> is the base functor of this recursive type:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data FTree a b = FLeaf a | FBranch b b

data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a)
</code></pre>
<p>An instance of <code>Rec</code> shows the relationship between the defining functor and the recursive type itself:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance Rec (-&gt;) (FTree a) (Tree a) where
  _in (FLeaf a) = Leaf a
  _in (FBranch a b) = Branch a b
  out (Leaf a) = FLeaf a
  out (Branch a b) = FBranch a b
</code></pre>
<p><code>FTree</code> is indeed a functor, so it is also a <code>HFunctor</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance HFunctor (-&gt;) (FTree a) where
  hmap f (FLeaf a) = FLeaf a
  hmap f (FBranch a b) = FBranch (f a) (f b)
</code></pre>
<p>These instances are enough to define folds and unfolds for this type. The following fold calculates the depth of a tree:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>depth :: Tree a -&gt; Int
depth = (fold :: (FTree a Int -&gt; Int) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Int) phi where
  phi :: FTree a Int -&gt; Int
  phi (FLeaf a) = 1
  phi (FBranch a b) = 1 + max a b
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 2 - Folding Perfect Binary Leaf Trees</h2>
<p>The second example is a fold for the nested (or non-regular) datatype of complete binary leaf trees.</p>
<p>The higher order functor <code>FCTree</code> defines the type constructor <code>CTree</code> as its fixed point:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data FCTree f a = FCLeaf a | FCBranch (f (a, a))

data CTree a = CLeaf a | CBranch (CTree (a, a))
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we define type class instances for HFunctor and Rec:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance HFunctor Nat FCTree where
  hmap (f :: Nat (f :: * -&gt; *) (g :: * -&gt; *)) = Nat ff where
    ff :: forall a. FCTree f a -&gt; FCTree g a
    ff (FCLeaf a) = FCLeaf a
    ff (FCBranch a) = FCBranch (nu f a)

instance Rec Nat FCTree CTree where
  _in = Nat inComplete where
    inComplete (FCLeaf a) = CLeaf a
    inComplete (FCBranch a) = CBranch a
  out = Nat outComplete where
    outComplete(CLeaf a) = FCLeaf a
    outComplete(CBranch a) = FCBranch a
</code></pre>
<p>Morphisms between type constructors are natural transformations, so we need a type constructor to act as the target of the fold. For our purposes, a constant functor will do:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data K a b = K a
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, the following fold calculates the depth of a complete binary leaf tree:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>cdepth :: CTree a -&gt; Int
cdepth c = let (K d) = nu (fold (Nat phi)) c in d where
  phi :: FCTree (K Int) a -&gt; K Int a
  phi (FCLeaf a) = K 1
  phi (FCBranch (K n)) = K (n + 1)
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 3 - Folding Even-Length Lists</h2>
<p>The final example is a fold for the pair of mutually recursive datatype of lists of even and odd lengths. The fold will take a list of even length and produce a list of pairs.</p>
<p>We cannot express type constructors in Haskell whose return kind is anything other than <code>*</code>, so we cheat a little and emulate the product kind using an arrow kind <code>Choice -&gt; *</code>, where <code>Choice</code> is a two point kind, lifted using the <code>DataKinds</code> extension:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data Choice = Fst | Snd
</code></pre>
<p>A morphism of pairs of types is just a pair of morphisms. For technical reasons, we represent this using a Church-style encoding, along with helper methods, as follows:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>newtype PHom h1 h2 p1 p2 = PHom { runPHom :: forall r. (h1 (p1 Fst) (p2 Fst) -&gt; h2 (p1 Snd) (p2 Snd) -&gt; r) -&gt; r }

mkPHom f g = PHom (\h -&gt; h f g)
fstPHom p = runPHom p (\f -&gt; \g -&gt; f)
sndPHom p = runPHom p (\f -&gt; \g -&gt; g)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>PHom</code> allows us to take two categories and form the product category:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance (Category h1, Category h2) =&gt; Category (PHom h1 h2) where
  ident = mkPHom ident ident
  compose p1 p2 = mkPHom (compose (fstPHom p1) (fstPHom p2)) (compose (sndPHom p1) (sndPHom p2))
</code></pre>
<p>We can define the types of lists of even and odd length as follows. Note that the kind annotation indicates the appearance of the kind <code>Choice -&gt; *</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data FAlt :: * -&gt; (Choice -&gt; *) -&gt; Choice -&gt; * where
  FZero :: FAlt a p Fst
  FSucc1 :: a -&gt; (p Snd) -&gt; FAlt a p Fst
  FSucc2 :: a -&gt; (p Fst) -&gt; FAlt a p Snd

data Alt :: * -&gt; Choice -&gt; * where
  Zero :: Alt a Fst
  Succ1 :: a -&gt; Alt a Snd -&gt; Alt a Fst
  Succ2 :: a -&gt; Alt a Fst -&gt; Alt a Snd
</code></pre>
<p>Again, we need to define instances of <code>Rec</code> and <code>HFunctor</code>:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>instance Rec (PHom (-&gt;) (-&gt;)) (FAlt a) (Alt a) where
  _in = mkPHom f g where
    f FZero = Zero
    f (FSucc1 a b) = Succ1 a b
    g (FSucc2 a b) = Succ2 a b
  out = mkPHom f g where
    f Zero = FZero
    f (Succ1 a b) = FSucc1 a b
    g (Succ2 a b) = FSucc2 a b

instance HFunctor (PHom (-&gt;) (-&gt;)) (FAlt a) where
  hmap p = mkPHom hf hg where
    hf FZero = FZero
    hf (FSucc1 a x) = FSucc1 a (sndPHom p x)
    hg (FSucc2 a x) = FSucc2 a (fstPHom p x)
</code></pre>
<p>As before, we create a target type for our fold, and this time a type synonym as well:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>data K2 :: * -&gt; * -&gt; Choice -&gt; * where
  K21 :: a -&gt; K2 a b Fst
  K22 :: b -&gt; K2 a b Snd

type PairUpResult a = K2 [(a, a)] (a, [(a, a)])
</code></pre>
<p>At last, here is the fold <code>pairUp</code>, taking even length lists to lists of pairs:</p>
<pre class="{.text}"><code>pairUp :: Alt a Fst -&gt; [(a, a)]
pairUp xs = let (K21 xss) = (fstPHom (fold (mkPHom phi psi))) xs in xss where
  phi FZero = K21 []
  phi (FSucc1 x1 (K22 (x2, xss))) = K21 ((x1, x2):xss) 
  psi (FSucc2 x (K21 xss)) = K22 (x, xss) 

test = Succ1 0 $ Succ2 1 $ Succ1 2 $ Succ2 3 $ Succ1 4 $ Succ2 5 Zero
</code></pre>
