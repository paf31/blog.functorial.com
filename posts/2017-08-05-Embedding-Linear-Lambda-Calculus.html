Why might you want to do this? Well, you might want to control access to some resource, or perhaps you&#39;ve heard that <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.5002" title="Liner types can change the world!">linear types can change the world</a> and now you&#39;d like to compile your EDSL to some target language and optimize things using mutable data structures.</p>
<p>There are existing techniques for embedding linear lambda calculus in a typed language like Haskell. For example, <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2804309" title="Embedding a full linear lambda calculus in Haskell">one approach is to use higher order abstract syntax</a>. However, I&#39;m going to show a simpler (but less powerful) technique. We won&#39;t get multiplicatives and additives, and we won&#39;t get a separate non-linear function type, but the implementation is tiny.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-substructural/" title="`purescript-substructural`"><code>purescript-substructural</code></a> library by @rightfold uses this technique to embed functions which are allowed to modify mutable data structures in place, and provides a great example with readable source code.</p>
<h2>Abstraction Elimination</h2>
<p>Abstraction elimination is the process of turning regular lambda calculus terms into point-free combinators. Proof-theoretically, it corresponds to the deduction theorem from first-order logic.</p>
<p>For the regular non-linear lambda calculus, abstraction elimination results in a term formed using the SKI basis. However, this won&#39;t work for the linear lambda calculus, since the S and K combinators are not linear! Instead, we can generate a term using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,_C,_K,_W_system" title="B, C, K, W system">&quot;BCI&quot; system</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>B</code> combinator is regular function composition:</p>
<pre><code>B = \x y z -&gt; x (y z)
</code></pre>
<p>And the <code>C</code> combinator is the <code>flip</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>C = \x y z -&gt; (x z) y
</code></pre>
<p>Now, consider the name <code>z</code> in each of these (linear) terms. It can only be used once, and in the case of the <code>B</code> combinator, it is used on the right of the outer function application, and on the left in the case of the <code>C</code> combinator.</p>
<p>This gives us an idea of how abstraction elimination can work in a linear setting - each time we see a function application, the variable we are trying to eliminate can only appear on one side of the application. Without loss of generality, it appears on the right (apply <code>C</code> if necessary), so we can eliminate the variable recursively using <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>Note that unlike regular abstraction elimination to SKI term, this algorithm has two benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no exponential explosion in term size, since we only need to recurse into one side of each function application.</li>
<li>The <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> combinators correspond to functions we use every day: <code>compose</code> and <code>flip</code>, so abstraction elimination actually results in understandable terms.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>As an example, consider the following lambda calculus term:</p>
<pre><code>\a b c d e -&gt; a (b c) (d e)
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s eliminate <code>e</code> first. It appears on the right, so we can use <code>B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>\a b c d -&gt; B (a (b c)) d
</code></pre>
<p>Eliminating <code>d</code> is easy, using eta conversion:</p>
<pre><code>\a b c -&gt; B (a (b c))
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can use <code>B</code> twice to eliminate <code>c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>\a b c -&gt; B ((B a b) c)
= \a b -&gt; B B (B a b)
</code></pre>
<p>To eliminate <code>b</code>, again notice that it appears on the right:</p>
<pre><code>\a b -&gt; (B B) ((B a) b)
= \a -&gt; B (B B) (B a)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, one more application of <code>B</code> eliminates <code>a</code>, giving our final point-free term:</p>
<pre><code>B (B (B B)) B
</code></pre>
<h2>A note about ordered, affine and relevant terms</h2>
<p>Notice, we never actually used the <code>C</code> combinator here. The reason is that nothing needed to be flipped, because all names were used in order.</p>
<p>The <em>ordered</em> linear lambda calculus consists of those terms which satisfy this property - not only must a name be used exactly once, but it must be used in the order it was declared.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s possible to express any ordered linear lambda calculus term using only the <code>B</code> and <code>I</code> combinators. I&#39;ve written up an implementation of the algorithm in PureScript <a href="http://try.purescript.org/?gist=7c3055b578a58428aeb31cfa43162b23">here</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that ordered linear terms can be interpreted in any category, since <code>B</code> and <code>I</code> are just the <code>compose</code> and <code>identity</code> functions!</p>
<p>Instead of dropping the <code>C</code> combinator, we could instead <em>add</em> the <code>K</code> combinator. The <code>K</code> combinator corresponds to the <code>const</code> function, and ignores its argument. We get <em>affine</em> lambda calculus terms, in which every function argument must be used at most once.</p>
<p>We can also add the <code>W</code> combinator if we want <em>relevant</em> lambda calculus, in which arguments must be used at least once.</p>
<p>If we add both <code>K</code> and <code>W</code>, we get regular old lambda calculus again, via the BCKW basis.</p>
<h2>Embedding linear lambda calculus</h2>
<p>So, now that we know how to perform abstraction elimination, how can we use this to embed a language of linear lambda calculus terms?</p>
<p>Well, simply create an abstract data type for linear terms, and hide the constructor. Provide a <code>Category</code> instance (which implements the <code>B</code> and <code>I</code> combinators) and a <code>flip</code> function (which implements the <code>C</code> combinator). In order to make your DSL useful, you will also want to provide some standard terms which the user can combine.</p>
<p>This approach requires the user to perform abstraction elimination on terms, but in practice, this is not a big problem. As we&#39;ve seen, the generated terms can be quite small, and straightforward. With something like typed holes (or even <em>type-directed search</em>), it can be quite simple to build these terms directly.</p>
<p>Because the constructor is hidden, we know that every term the user builds must use its argument linearly, and we might be able to exploit this property for optimization purposes</p>
<p>As another little example, <a href="http://try.purescript.org/?gist=51d7971a85d6e1cd38b02e04e2fa1ced">this</a> shows how we might use this approach to ensure that resources such as file handles are always accessed exactly once.</p>
