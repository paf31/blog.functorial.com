<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>First, the two players agree on an algebraic data type, expressible in Haskell. Recursive types tend to work best.</p>
<p>For example, we might choose the type of <code>[()]</code> of lists of elements of type <code>()</code>.</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The goal is to write an exhaustive function <code>f</code> from the chosen type to <code>()</code>, by pattern matching. The return type isn&#39;t important, so I use <code>()</code> here arbitrarily.</p>
<p>So the players agree on the type signature:</p>
<pre><code>f :: [()] -&gt; ()
</code></pre>
<p>Player one goes first, and writes down the first line of the function, which consists of a pattern recognizing some subset of the values of the chosen type.</p>
<p>For example, player one might choose the following:</p>
<pre><code>f (_ : _ : _) = ()
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the only thing which is important here is the pattern itself.</p>
<p>Player two goes next, but there is an additional rule - a player cannot introduce a <em>redundant pattern</em>. For example, it would be an illegal move for player two to write down the pattern <code>(_ : _ : _ : _)</code> at this point, since that pattern doesn&#39;t match any new values.</p>
<p>Play continues in this way, and the last player to write down a non-redundant pattern loses.</p>
<p>So, for example, player two might legally write down the next line as:</p>
<pre><code>f [] = ()
</code></pre>
<p>forcing player one to cover the only remaining case:</p>
<pre><code>f [_] = ()
</code></pre>
<p>and so player two would win.</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This game is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poset_game">poset game</a>, where the poset is given by the choice of type. It generalizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a>, since choosing an N-ary sum of natural numbers recovers a game of Nim with N heaps.</p>
<p>It is possible for gameplay to go on indefinitely. For example, in the game above, the players could alternately choose patterns matching lists of increasing fixed length: <code>[]</code>, <code>[_]</code>, <code>[_, _]</code>, ..., and the function would never become exhaustive. However, it is possible to force a finite game by choosing a pattern which matches a cofinite number of values.</p>
<p>Try it and let me know what you think!</p>
